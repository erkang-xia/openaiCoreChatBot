I woke up really early, even before the sun was all the way up. I tried to make my own breakfast, but I spilled the cereal everywhere. It was so funny! Mom wasn't mad, she just laughed and helped me clean it up. Then, I had chocolate milk. Yum!\n\nIn school, we did arts and crafts. I made a picture with lots of glitter and glue. My hands got all sticky, but the picture looked like a shiny rainbow. My teacher said it was very creative. I felt so proud!\n\nAt recess, I played with my best friend, Alex. We pretended we were astronauts exploring a new planet. The playground was our spaceship. It was really fun because we found alien bugs (they were just ants, but we pretended they were aliens).\n\nAfter school, Dad took me to the park. We fed the ducks, and I tried to run as fast as the squirrels. I can't run that fast yet, but Dad says maybe when I'm older. We had ice cream too. I got chocolate, and it got all over my face. Dad laughed and took a photo.\n\nFor dinner, we had pizza, my favorite! I got to put on my own toppings. I made a smiley face with pepperoni and olives. It was so cool!\n\nBefore bed, Mom read me a story. It was about a dragon and a princess who were friends. I like that story a lot. I wish I had a dragon friend.\n\nI'm really tired now, but today was the best day ever. I can't wait for tomorrow. I hope it's just as fun!", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 1372, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}}, "docstore/ref_doc_info": {"0c319a5d-6e52-4c2c-b860-ea4d4d7d853d": {"node_ids": ["902cca79-198b-4791-8045-bf81a33f43a5"], "metadata": {"file_path": "data/\u8bb0\u5fc6.txt", "file_name": "\u8bb0\u5fc6.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 1372, "creation_date": "2024-01-24", "last_modified_date": "2024-01-24", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-24"}}}}
